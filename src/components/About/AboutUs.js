        Why Opportunity Hack?
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" style={style} paragraph>        
        üßëüèø‚Äçüíª As computer science students or software engineers, we have a moral and ethical obligation to use our skills to make a positive impact on the world. One way to do this is by contributing to Opportunity Hack, a hackathon focused on creating technology solutions for social good.
        <br /><br />
        üí° By participating in Opportunity Hack, you have the opportunity to use your technical skills to make a real difference in the lives of others. In addition to the personal satisfaction of using your skills for good, participating in Opportunity Hack can also help you build your resume and portfolio. Demonstrating your ability to create technology solutions that have a positive impact on society can be a powerful way to stand out to potential employers and make a name for yourself in the industry.
        <br /><br />
        ‚ù§Ô∏è But perhaps most importantly, contributing to Opportunity Hack can evoke a sense of purpose and fulfillment that is often missing from traditional software engineering jobs. By using your skills to help others, you can find meaning and satisfaction in your work that goes beyond just writing code.
        <br /><br />
