            Opportunity Hack stands out in several ways:
          </Typography>
          <Typography component="ol">
            <li>
              <strong>Real-world impact:</strong> We focus on creating lasting
              solutions for nonprofits, not just demo projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Open-ended challenges:</strong> Unlike hackathons with
              predefined ideas, we present open-ended problems from nonprofits,
              encouraging truly innovative and tailored solutions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Code-centric approach:</strong> We minimize workshops to
              maximize coding time, emphasizing hands-on learning and
              development.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Professional leadership:</strong> Our events are run by
              industry professionals passionate about coding for social good,
              not by students.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Long-term support:</strong> We provide resources and
              mentorship for teams to continue development post-event.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recognition system:</strong> Our 'Hearts' system
              acknowledges ongoing volunteer contributions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Year-round community:</strong> We foster a strong network
              of socially-conscious technologists through continuous engagement.
            </li>
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            This unique approach ensures meaningful projects, practical
            learning, and sustained impact in the nonprofit sector.

            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Complete product development lifecycle vs. rapid prototyping</li>
            <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> Regular ongoing mentorship vs. event-based guidance</li>
            <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Production-ready software with real users vs. demo projects</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Remote participation with flexible scheduling</li>
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Perfect for students and early career professionals in software engineering, product management, UX/UI design, data science, and DevOps who want to build meaningful experience while creating lasting social impact.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            The program culminates in a demo day with partner organizations, giving you real-world experience presenting to stakeholders and seeing your work make a tangible difference.
